# Twitter Follower Base Analysis

## Basic Idea
Simple text analysis on tweets by various twitter accounts: Correlate word frequency with amount of favorites/retweets. Insight will reveal more about follower base of each account we analyze rather than the account owner themselves because favorites and retweets are generated by followers.

## Data Sources
- Twitter

## Techniques Involved
- basic NLP
- data streaming from Twitter API
- regression

## Potential Endgoals
- predict plateau favorite/retweet amount the moment a tweet is tweeted by a monitored account
	- calculate average time to plateau fav/rt amt
- wordclouds based on reactions elicited by each word rather than on word frequency
- sentiment analysis on replies to see how people feel about each word used
- national heat map for word popularity
	- most popular word/topic in by state
