# What is Data Science?

## Basic Idea
It's been almost 5 years since Harvard Business Review published [an article proclaiming data scientist as the sexiest job of the century](https://hbr.org/2012/10/data-scientist-the-sexiest-job-of-the-21st-century). Yet, today, we still find the field in flux with a myriad of conflicting definitions of what the phrase entails. We want to perform NLP on job postings to figure out what it means to most companies to be a "data scientist".

## Data Sources
- [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com)
- [Glassdoor](https://www.glassdoor.com)
- other job search engines

## Techniques Involved
- NLP
- web scraping
	- unnecessary if job search engines have APIs

## Potential Endgoals
- rank common definitions based on word frequency
- consider difference in earnings correlated with different definitions
- compare definitions based on location
